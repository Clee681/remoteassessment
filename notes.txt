create a new row in the student_assignments table => should track whether or not they have completed?
create all of the necessary messages in the messages table
cron job should run checking whether or not to send the initial assignment description
once the initial assignment description is sent, all of the questions are waiting to be sent
in the correct order

keeping track of the student's progress on any given assignment:
log the number of questions for a given assignment in the student_assignments table
can then cross reference the number of remaining rows in the messages table

if we receive a text message back from a student we need to figure out which assignment they were on,
and which question they answered. 

have a list command which allows the user to type list, which then sends back
a list of outstanding assignments with an id. the student can then switch assignments
by texting back the assignment id. the default is the last assignment they were on

student_assignments.get_next_unsent_message
- this method should check for a given assignment what is the next message to be sent

Immediate To-Dos:
create a messages model & respective migration

messages
id   from:string  to:string  content:string  assignment_id  student_id   order
